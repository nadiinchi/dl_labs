If the eigenvalue is large, it means that loss changes a lot in the direction of corresponding eigenvector. On the contrary, if eigenvalue is small, the loss is flat in the corresponding direction. Experiments show that near optima there are several large eigenvalues and a lot of small eigenvalues. From this the authors conclude that optima form large connected components at the bottom of the landscape.\n",

They relate this moment to the batch size and learning rate. You may also repeat this experiment."
